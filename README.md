This is a fun little word game built with React and styled with CSS. Alternate taking turns with the computer, playing a letter each turn, trying to make a valid 6 letter word. The computer goes first, and might throw you off by playing an unexpected letter in a subsequent turn (you'll have to try to figure out what word the program is thinking of). Gain 1 point for each correct letter, lose 1 point if you play a letter that doesn't conform to a valid word in our list. Try to get as many points as you can in 3 minutes!
